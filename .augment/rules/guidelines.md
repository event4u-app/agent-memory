# Guidelines

Coding guidelines live in `.augment/guidelines/` organized by language.
**Always check the relevant guideline** before writing or reviewing code.

## Available Guidelines

### PHP (`.augment/guidelines/php/`)

| File | Topic |
|---|---|

| `controllers.md` | Thin controllers, single responsibility, delegation to services |
| `eloquent.md` | Model conventions, relationships, scopes, accessors/mutators |
| `validations.md` | FormRequest patterns, custom rules, validation structure |
| `resources.md` | API Resource conventions, response structure |
| `jobs.md` | Queue job patterns, serialization, retry strategies |
| `git.md` | Branch naming, commit messages, PR conventions |

## How guidelines work

- **Guidelines** = coding conventions (read on demand)
- **Rules** = behavior constraints (auto-loaded)
- **Skills** = capabilities/workflows (topic-matched)

## Adding new guidelines

New language/framework → create `.augment/guidelines/{language}/`. Follow PHP structure as template.
Read specific file on demand — don't memorize full list.
