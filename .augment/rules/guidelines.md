## How guidelines work

- **Guidelines** = detailed coding conventions (reference material, read on demand)
- **Rules** = always-active behavior constraints (auto-loaded every conversation)
- **Skills** = agent capabilities and workflows (matched by topic)

Guidelines are the "how to write code" docs. Rules enforce critical subsets automatically.
Skills reference guidelines when performing related tasks.

## Boundary: Guidelines vs Skills

- Guidelines contain **conventions and reference knowledge**. Skills contain **executable workflows**.
- A skill may reference a guideline for conventions, but must NOT outsource its core execution steps to a guideline.
- Do NOT move a skill's operational core (procedure, validation, decision logic) into a guideline.
- If a skill becomes "go read the guideline", it has lost its purpose — restore the workflow.

## Adding new guidelines

When a new language or framework is introduced, create a directory:
```
.augment/guidelines/{language}/
```

Follow the existing PHP structure as a template.

Read the specific guideline file on demand — don't memorize the full list.
