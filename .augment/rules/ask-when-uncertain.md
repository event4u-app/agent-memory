# Ask When Uncertain

**When in doubt, ask the user.** Do not guess, assume, or improvise.
Asking one question too many is always better than a wrong assumption.

## When to ask

- Requirement is ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- Not 100% sure which approach is correct
- About to touch code you haven't fully understood
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- A fix "seems to work" but you can't explain why

## Vague-request triggers — MUST ask

The following patterns are almost always too vague to execute safely. When the user's
request matches one of these without further context, ask **before** touching code:

| Pattern | Missing info | Example question |
|---|---|---|
| "improve / optimize this" | What metric? Speed, readability, memory? | "Optimize for what — execution speed or readability?" |
| "add caching" | Cache store? Scope? Invalidation rules? | "Which cache driver, and what invalidates it?" |
| "make it better / cleaner" | By what standard? | "What specifically feels wrong in the current code?" |
| "clean up this file" | Dead code? Formatting? Refactor? | "Remove unused code, reformat, or restructure?" |
| "fix this" (without specifying) | What's the symptom? | "What output/behavior is wrong right now?" |
| "refactor X" | Target pattern? Boundaries? | "Refactor toward what — smaller methods, extract class, or something else?" |
| "use best practices" | Whose? For what? | "Best practices for what specifically — testing, naming, structure?" |
| "handle errors properly" | Which errors? How? Log, retry, propagate? | "For which failure modes, and what should happen on error?" |

**Escape hatch:** If surrounding context (ticket, open file, prior conversation)
makes the answer unambiguous, proceed — but state the assumption explicitly.

## How to ask

Be specific. Present numbered options (per `user-interaction`). Keep it short.

- Simple (binary, small): multiple at once, numbered
- Complex (needs thinking): one at a time, wait for answer
- Handoff (model switch): ask LAST
